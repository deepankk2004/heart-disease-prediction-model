# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Description
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to analyze clinical data and predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Key normalization techniques are applied to standardize the input features, which helps in improving the accuracy and reliability of the model.

## Getting Started

### Dataset
The dataset includes clinical features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- and more.

This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed using various normalization techniques, such as Min-Max Scaling and Z-Score Normalization. This step ensures that the features are on a similar scale, which is crucial for the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

### Model Training
Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored in this project, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The models are trained on the preprocessed dataset, and hyperparameters are fine-tuned to achieve the best possible performance.

### Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using several metrics, including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

Visualizations such as ROC curves and confusion matrices are provided to give a detailed understanding of the model's performance.

## Help
If you encounter any issues, ensure the following:
- The dataset is correctly preprocessed and normalized.
- The machine learning libraries and dependencies are properly installed.
- The model's hyperparameters are appropriately tuned.
For additional help, refer to the documentation of the machine learning libraries used in this project, or consult relevant community forums.
